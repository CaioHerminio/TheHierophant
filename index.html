            <h2>The Hierophant</h2>
            <p>The Hierophant stands at the threshold of mystery and tradition, a bridge between divine truths and human understanding.
                He wears the robes of sacred authority, yet his power lies not in command but in initiation. Through him, old knowledge is preserved and passed down, cloaked in ritual and symbol. He reminds us that wisdom is not only discovered—it is inherited, honored, and protected. In his presence, we learn to kneel not in submission, but in reverence. He teaches that belief is a path, not a cage, and doctrine is the soil where spirit may bloom. Often misunderstood as rigid, the Hierophant is the silent key to the ancient doors. He does not speak for the gods—but teaches you to listen.</p>

            <h2>Taurus</h2>
            <p>Taurus anchors the Hierophant’s teachings in the physical realm—steadfast, enduring, and sensual. Just as Taurus honors value through ritual and repetition, the Hierophant reveals the sacred in the familiar. He teaches that true spiritual wealth is cultivated through patience, practice, and trust.</p>

            <h2>Chokmah - Chesed</h2>
            <p>This path joins raw divine wisdom (Chokmah/Uranus) with benevolent structure (Chesed/Jupiter), giving form to divine inspiration. The Hierophant channels celestial insight into ethical order, making abstract truth accessible to human hearts.</p>
